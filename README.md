# Data analysis and visualization of the Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) 2018 

This is an overview of teachers’ preparedness to teach cross-curricular skills (e.g., critical thinking, creativity, problem solving). Specifically, I look at teachers of lower secondary education, both on an international level as well as in Austria in particular. The findings are the result of analysing the <a href = "http://www.oecd.org/education/talis/">OECD Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) 2018</a>, which includes data about 153,682 teachers in 47 countries.

## Aim 

This analysis informed the development of a research project at the University of Graz, Austria (<a href= "https://anglistik.uni-graz.at/de/fachdidaktik/">Department of English Language Didactics</a>). The project aims to investigate Austrian language teachers' knowledge, attitudes and skills regarding the teaching of global skills (i.e. critical thinking, collaboration, wellbeing skills, sustainability,...) in the language classroom.

The question I intend to answer are:
1. How well prepared are teachers of all subjects and countries to teach cross-curricular skills?
2. How well prepared are language teachers of all countries to teach cross-curricular skills?
3. How well prepared are foreign language teachers of all countries to teach cross-curricular skills compared to teachers of other subjects?
4. How well prepared are Austrian language teachers to teach cross-curricular skills compared to teachers of other subjects?
5. How well prepared are Austrian language teachers, who have less than 10 years of teaching experience, to teach cross-curricular skills compared to teachers of other subjects?

For each question, the percentage of teachers who received training about teaching cross-curricular skills in their formal teacher education, teachers’ perceived preparedness to teach these skills, the percentage of teachers who received professional development about teaching cross-curricular skills in the 12 months prior to the survey, and teachers’ needs to undergo professional development about teaching these skills are given.

## Findings

1. Austrian teachers (of all subjects) receive very little training and feel badly prepared with respect to teaching cross-curricular skills in comparison to teachers in other countries (see list of country abbreviations in the appendix).

The same holds true for language teachers.

2.  While Austrian teachers of all subjects receive little training in the discussed field, Austrian language teachers appear especially badly prepared with respect to teaching cross-curricular skills.

This situation seems to be better for language teachers with less than 10 years teaching experience. This might imply that teacher training is gradually incorporating the necessary education for teachers in order to teach cross-curricular skills.

3. Overall, the analysis supports the claim of many educational researchers (e.g. Mercer et al., 2019) to put more emphasis on the professional training of teachers regarding knowledge and tools to incorporate cross-curricular skills into their lessons and teaching philosophy.
